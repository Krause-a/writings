This will be a document of whatever questions I have.

### 1. How can I set up a comfortable setup for my keyboard?

My keyboad is an iris from [keeb.io](https://keeb.io). It is a split columnar 60% keyboard with cyan keycaps. Having a pillow in my lap makes it possible to have a comfortable setup for keyboard only. The mouse is too far away for any practical use. The ideal setup must be on desk. It must be tented and angled back a bit. My current tenting solution is a half used large ball of yarn. This does the tenting well enough but lacks the stability required for worry free typing. **Unfinished**

### 2. I forgot what to ask. What is a question worth asking?

A question worth asking is dependent on the context it is asked. In a document like this, simple or silly questions are good.

### 3. What color is best?

Green. The majority of our environment should be green, brown, and blue. Small accents of brighter colors can be added sparingly.

### 4. What should my wife do this evening?

Work or crochet? Work.

### 5. How can I practice more different markdown syntax?

How about I just put some syntax tests down here.

    const testing = 55;
    console.log(testing);// Will print 55

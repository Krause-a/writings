This will be a document of whatever questions I have.

### 1. How can I setup a comfortable setup for my keyboard?

My keyboad is an iris from [keeb.io](https://keeb.io). It is a split columnar 60% keyboard with cyan keycaps. Having a pillow in my lap makes it possible to have a comfortable setup for keyboard only. The mouse is too far away for any practical use. The ideal setup must be on desk. It must be tented and angled back a bit. My current tenting solution is a half used large ball of yarn. This does the tenting well enough but lacks the stability required for worry free typing.
